# Types of use

Each Spot in use follows the same simple pattern: a QR code links to a final URL. In practice, it's possible to create a typology of uses and show what's at stake in each choice.

!!! note

    As the QR code is normally scanned on a mobile phone, care must be taken to ensure that the final URL leads to content accessible on smartphones and tablets. This is the main constraint for any type of use.

## Link to existing pages on your site

The simplest use of Spot in is to link to existing web pages on your own site. For an organization, it's an opportunity to make links between a QR code affixed in one place and a specific page in a tree structure.

### Practical examples

In front of all the administrative buildings in a town, a QR code is printed on the nameplates. On the city's official website, it links directly to the page with the department's opening hours and contact details.

### Benefits

- no need to develop specific content
- no need to create a site
- showcase your own site

### Disadvantages

- visitors arrive on a site that is often too complex
- no exclusivity for surfers (the page may already be known)

## Tailor-made site

This is the solution chosen by the *association Spot in* to offer an optimal user experience. As the site is designed from the outset to receive visits from QR code readers on smartphones, it can be well optimized.

From a technical point of view, any site that can be used on a smartphone can be used. For example:

- a static site that's highly durable
- a WordPress site with a simple, high-performance theme

!!! note

    The *association Spot in* proposes(ra) a kit under free license to create a static site generated with Hugo. They use it for some of their projects. More info: [static site with Hugo](/hugo/)

### Practical example

A medium-sized town offers a combination of sport and culture by the lake. In this example, there is no navigation menu in production. Content pages can only be accessed via Spot in. In other words, only by visiting the site and scanning a QR code.

### Benefits

- navigation can be simplified or eliminated
- exclusivity (a page can only be accessed by Spot in)
- durability
- segregation of duties (changes to content intended for Spot in do not affect the institution's official site)

### Disadvantages

- creation of additional content
- need to develop a specific site

## links to external content

Spot in can be used to link to content not on a domain name managed by the company.

### Practical example

A large city whose history, neighborhoods and buildings are well documented on Wikipedia decides to create QR codes that link only to this online encyclopedia.

In one case, it decides to link to a TV program about its flower market available online.

### Benefits

- enhancement of existing high-quality content
- no need to create own content
- no technical maintenance

### Disadvantages

- no control over current page status (e.g. Wikipedia)
- deletion of pages always possible
