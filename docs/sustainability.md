# Sustainability

Spot in ensures the durability of redirects. This is a must for organizations wishing to engrave QR codes that remain identical for years.

Too many QR codes lead to empty pages, changed content or 404 errors. The *association Spot in* offers a solution to avoid these errors

## Durability of the solution

The Spot in solution is supported by the *association Spot in*. The association is financed by its users, and ensures the longevity of its solution.

Spot in undertakes to maintain all redirections for at least XXX years.

## Editable QR codes

QR codes are never modifiable. It always refers to a specific URL that never changes. The advantage of Spot in is that it acts as an intermediary. The final redirection URL can be modified at any time. With the following advantages:

- when a site's structure changes, referrals are modified to arrive at the new address (even when the site doesn't manage the redirection of its new URLs)
- a QR code can be modified remotely (no need to physically go to the site to affix a new code)
- it's independent of the destination site (all CMS allow redirections, but they're often abandoned during redesigns)

## Unique identifiers

Each spot has a unique identifier (*unique ID*). Even if the spot is deactivated, the ID remains assigned. So an abandoned spot can never be replaced by another spot.
