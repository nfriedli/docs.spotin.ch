# Definition of a spot

The basic principle: a single QR code links to a final URL.

A spot is not just a URL redirection, but a simple object.


## Unique ID

A unique ID is assigned to a spot when it is created. It is generated automatically and cannot be modified. The uniqueness of the QR code is ensured by the uniqueness of the ID.
